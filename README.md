# CVE-2022-36804-PoC-Exploit
A somewhat reliable PoC exploit for CVE-2022-36804 (BitBucket Critical Command Injection). This attack generally requires public repos to be enabled, however session cookies are also compatible with this exploit. Note: this exploit includes automatic repo detection which is handy if you don't want to manually find open repos yourself.
